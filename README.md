# Python-Lasso-ElasticNet-Ridge-Regression-with-Customized-Penalties
An extension of sklearn's Lasso/ElasticNet/Ridge model to allow users to customize the penalties of different covariates. In R this can be done by setting the penalty.factor parameter in glmnet but in python AFAIK there's no such implementation yet.
